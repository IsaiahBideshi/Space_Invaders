### More Info

This was a personal project done to teach myself of object oriented programming as well as how to read documentation for external libraries, 
in this case it was SMFL. As of creating this game, I am a year 1 Computer Science student so this sort of knowledge is new to me. This
project will serve as practice of OOP for my upcoming courses to gain a headstart.
