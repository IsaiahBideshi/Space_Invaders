## Installation

I have not created a release of the game, so to install you need to download all the files, compile and run in c++ to play. <br>
A release is coming soon!

### More Info

This was a personal project done to teach myself of object oriented programming as well as how to read documentation for external libraries, 
in this case it was SMFL. As of creating this game, I am a year 1 Computer Science student so this sort of knowledge is new to me. This
project will serve as practice of OOP for my upcoming courses to gain a headstart.


### Disclaimer
The demo has an incorrect high score value that will be fixed eventually.
The high score value should be stored locally.
